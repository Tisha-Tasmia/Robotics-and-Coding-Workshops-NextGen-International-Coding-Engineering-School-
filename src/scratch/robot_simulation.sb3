//A sample project for Robot Movement Simulation

ðŸ¤– Scratch Project: Robot Simulation (robot_simulation.sb3)
This Scratch project simulates a simple robot moving autonomously, avoiding obstacles, and responding to user commands.

Features:
The robot moves forward automatically.
It detects obstacles (e.g., a wall) and turns.
The user can control the robot with arrow keys.

Steps to Create the Project in Scratch
Open Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu) and create a new project.

Add Sprites:

Click on "Choose a Sprite" and select:
Robot (as the main sprite)
Wall (obstacles for simulation)
Resize and duplicate walls as needed.
Add a Background (e.g., a grid or a lab setup).

Code for Robot Movement (Autonomous Navigation):

Select the Robot Sprite.

Add this script:

blocks
Copy
Edit
when [green flag] clicked
forever
  move (4) steps
  if <touching [Wall v] ?> then
    say [Obstacle detected!] for (1) seconds
    turn right (random (90) to (180)) degrees
  end
end
User-Controlled Movement (Override Mode)

Add another script for manual control:

blocks
Copy
Edit
when [up arrow] key pressed
move (5) steps

when [left arrow] key pressed
turn left (15) degrees

when [right arrow] key pressed
turn right (15) degrees
Save the Project:

Click File > Save to your computer.
Name it robot_simulation.sb3.
